In this project, we are going to make a DIY Digital Camera of our own. For this purpose we have a ESP32 Wrover module based Touchscreen Camera module from Makerfabs. It is a sleek 3.5" TFT LCD display which is connected with the ESP Wrover module and has an onboard Camera of 2 MP. WIth the help of this camera we can capture photographs and save them on an SD Card as the Module also has an SD Card slot as well. We can also live stream over Wifi using this module. So what we are going to do is that we will convert this module into a camera and another project that we are going to make is a Wifi based Screenshot Receiver which transmits data on your screen to the module and displays that onto the module's display.

We can also maske a lot of other projects using this module as the possibilities are endless. One example that I must give is of playing retro games using this module. You can play some fun games like 2048, Flappy birdz etc by just uploading some simple codes in the module. You can also make a drawing tab using this module on which you can draw and write using your fingers. So you can see there are a lot of possible projects that can be made using this module and have fun with. We also have some GPIO pins on it with which we can attach sensors/actuators and build something new.
